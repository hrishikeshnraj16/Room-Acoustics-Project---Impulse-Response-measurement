# Room Impulse Response Study

An assessed submission from my MSc Acoustics course at the University of Edinburgh. This project presents a comparative room acoustics study of lecture and concert spaces using impulse response measurements. Swept-sine and impulsive methods were used to derive RT60 (T20/T30), clarity metrics (C50, C80, D50), and energy decay curves, relating measured parameters to the suitability of each space for speech and music.
