# Room-Acoustics-Project---Impulse-Response-measurement
A submission from my MSc Acoustics course at the University of Edinburgh. This project compares room impulse responses of lecture and concert spaces, analysing RT60, clarity (C50, C80, D50), and decay behaviour using swept-sine and impulsive measurements.
